# Project2

I couldn't come up with a realistic theme, I was watching one piece and we had ships and I thought of a cannonball as my ball and ships as paddle woo!

I TRIED TO GET THE ENDGAME UI WORKING AND BALL SELECTOR BUT I GOT LAZY AND TIRED BECAUSE MY CODE WAS VERY MESSY
I WILL KEEP THIS IN MIND FOR THE NEXT PROJECT (MODULARIZE)

EVERYTHING ELSE WORKS:
* Paddles can move independently
* Ball bounces off the paddles
* Paddles cannot go off the screen
* Both players can use keyboard (UP AND DOWN and W AND S)
* If t is pressed, then the left ship (Ship One) starts to go up and down
* My ships and cannonball are textured

* Ball bounces off the top and bottom of the screen

* The game ends when the ball hits the left or right wall

As for extra credit:
* I had a theme i guess
* Endgame UI not done
* Option to pick balls not done
